title = 'About me'
+++

My name is JÃ¸rund Dahl, and I work at KONE in Finland as Principal Platform Architect in the Digital Workplace Platforms team. I have a broad background from IT infrastructure, mostly focused on end user computing, security, identity and Microsoft 365.

Most of my work experience has been in large global companies, which poses many unique challenges when business requirements meets technology.

I enjoy following implementation projects from start to finish. Translating business requirements to projects, architectural design, technical implementation and hopefully a lot of automation / scripting in between.
