      <description>Is your company paying for extra SharePoint storage? Would you like not to?
What is it? SharePoint and OneDrive automatically saves major or minor versions as you work, so there is a history of changes that you can access and revert to if needed. Microsoft recently started rolling out general availability of feature ID 145802: &amp;ldquo;SharePoint: Improvements for document library version history limits&amp;rdquo;. In simpler terms this means we now have an automatic way of thinning out the version history of files and documents in SharePoint Online.</description>

      <description>This article will dive into license optimization. Which reports and measurements are available to us, and what are the important metrics to guide the decision on which license package a user needs? Ultimately, we want to use this information to reduce cost, but it can also help us to discover if we are uncompliant according to the license contract.
